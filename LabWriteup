2. a) Identify levels of nodes:
	a - 3
	f - 1
	g - 4

	p - 2
	
	b) The height of the tree is the is the length of the path from the 
	root to a node on the lowest level. An example of the node on the lowest
	level is g, and the length of the path from g to the root is 4. This the 
	height of the tree is 4.
